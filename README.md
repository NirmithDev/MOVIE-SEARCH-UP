- This is just a simple lookup of all movies and actors
- to run install EVERYTHING first like download the files and all sots of data ye
- after that it is as simple as running npm install
- then you are pretty much done with it
- you can lookup actors and movies by search (dynamic) this is just stored locally at the moment there will be a different add on for database-initializer
- yeah that's about it after you are done with that you just type node ./server.js
- then just go to your browser and type localhost:3000

This project is a continous work of integration and updates! Unfortunately I have to put a break since I am heading into my final year semesters and it is all or nothing
I thank you all and you can feel free to work on the issues opened when you feel like it!

I will resume this project when I am free so maybe during Christmas break and Winter semester end break!

# Update functionality

- search and store in viewer's history (will work on making it based on sessions so that not all user's will get based on it)
- authentication and sessions added along with profile and home page authentication check functionality
- some logic errors are there will focus on it
- next to do is add reviews for movies and stuff
- set add movies to admin only
- add an extra step in registration to set user to admin or a normal user
- final step is to add a add to watch later button that will be stored in user's profile

# Next steps

- needs the backend functionality to update the movie data (Edit functionality)
- search up other user's functionality
- add follow user to list functionality for all user's
- code if possible the reply to each comment
- add notification system if possible
- incorporate databases and enable editing into DB
