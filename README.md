- This is just a simple lookup of all movies and actors
- to run install EVERYTHING first like download the files and all sots of data ye
- after that it is as simple as running npm install
- then you are pretty much done with it
- you can lookup actors and movies by search (dynamic) this is just stored locally at the moment there will be a different add on for database-initializer
- yeah that's about it after you are done with that you just type node ./server.js
- then just go to your browser and type localhost:3000

# Update functionality

- search and store in viewer's history (will work on making it based on sessions so that not all user's will get based on it)
- authentication and sessions added along with profile and home page authentication check functionality
- some logic errors are there will focus on it

# next steps

- next to do is add reviews for movies and stuff
- final step is to add a add to watch later button that will be stored in user's profile
- if time available incorporate databases
