- This is just a simple lookup of all movies and actors 
- to run install EVERYTHING first like download the files and all sots of data ye
- after that it is as simple as running npm install
- then you are pretty much done with it
- you can lookup actors and movies by search (dynamic) this is just stored locally at the moment there will be a different add on for database-initializer 
- yeah that's about it after you are done with that you just type node ./server.js
- then just go to your browser and type localhost:3000
